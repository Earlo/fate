# Fate Character Sheet Manager

Something I made to help me run a game based on Fate Core rules.
Not super professional, but happy to help if someone wants to use this also.

### Project goals

This software isn't meant to be a virtual table top simulator or an online RPG platform, but instead a simple additional tool to use in live game sessions, making them more streamlined by providing each player with access to all the relevant information.

## Features

- Create Character Sheets
  - Possible skills are tied to campaigns you are taking part in
  - Also supports free form skill input
  - AI powered note writing tool for the DM (WIP)
- Create Campaigns
  - Define Skills used in campaign
  - Define aspects of the campaign
  - Group characters
  - Reveal partial character sheets to players as GM
